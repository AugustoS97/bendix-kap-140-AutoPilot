Only electronics, you can choose the microcontroller of your choice, the base design have addtionnal card for Mega2560R3.

For mine i use Mega2560R3 and Mobiflight on MSFS2020--> <a href='https://www.mobiflight.com/en/index.html'>MOBIFLIGHT</a><BR />
For others controllers you need to design the support for the card, or add wires to link them.
