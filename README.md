Build your own autopilot for simulation cockpit cessna 172.<BR />
Format 159x41 mm for 6.25" stack<BR />
Electronics are design with EasyEDA.<BR />
3D parts are design with SolidWorks.<BR />

Only electronics, you can choose the microcontroller of your choice, the base design have addtionnal card for Mega2560R3.

For mine i use Mega2560R3 and Mobiflight on MSFS2020--> <a href='https://www.mobiflight.com/en/index.html'>MOBIFLIGHT</a><BR />
For others controllers you need to design the support for the card, or add wires to link them.
